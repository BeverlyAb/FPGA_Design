#Rotating Square Circuit

This behaves as a Moore machine, which displays a rotating square that iterates across the four seven segment (sseg) displays every clock cycle (clk). 

 en halts or resumes the process.
 cw, makes the square rotate clockwise or counter-clockwise. an enables one 
 of the four sseg outputs its value. Using this Finite State Machine (FSM), the
 square retains its position even after the en or cw switch is toggled.
