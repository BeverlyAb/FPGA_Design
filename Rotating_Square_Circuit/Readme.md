 This behaves as a Moore machine displaying a square rotating every clock cycle (clk) across the four seven segment (sseg) display. 

 en halts or resumes the process.
 cw, makes the square rotate clockwise or counter-clockwise. an enables one 
 of the four sseg outputs its value. Using this Finite State Machine (FSM), the
 square retains its position even after the en or cw switch is toggled.
