Both designs, Bidirectional_rotator and Barrel_rotator, take in data_in, lr, and amount in order to output the rotated value, data_out. 
The number of bits to rotate is set by amount, while lr dictates whether to perform left rotation (lr ==1) or right rotation (lr ==0).

More information is on the lab report.
