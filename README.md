# FPGA_Design
These are projects written in Verilog, which are implemented onto the Spartan3, FPGA.

Resources for these projects are from Pong P Chu's, "FPGA Prototyping by Verilog Examples:
Xilinx Spartan-3 Version" with more information at http://academic.csuohio.edu/chu_p/rtl/fpga_vlog.html 

*Feel free to use my work as a reference, but please refrain from copying code from these projects to serve as assignments in computer science related courses.*
